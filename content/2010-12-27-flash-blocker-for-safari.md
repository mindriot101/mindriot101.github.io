*Update:* Wed 27 Feb 2013, since I'm updating this blog, chrome and firefox and safari all support this feature. 


Google Chrome has\* one, Firefox has one but Safari does not... until
now!

For me, having a manual "load flash only when I tell you to" button in a
web browser is a must. This reduces CPU usage on my mac which increases
battery life and stops it getting too hot. These are nice things to
have!

I understand some people might not want such a feature, but I do so I
did some quick googling and came up withÂ [https://clicktoflash.com/](https://clicktoflash.com/).
It creates a nice smooth looking flash image (shown below) which you
click to add the flash item itself.

It also includes a whitelist for sites you know to be ok. Check it out
if you run safari on a mac (seeing as windows does not have this problem
- its only selling point really!)
