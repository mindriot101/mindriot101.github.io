Tomorrow I fly to Victoria, Canada to attend the [International Astronomical Union Symposium 299](https://www.di.utoronto.ca/research/iaus-299/), entitled *Exploring the formation and evolution of planetary systems*. I'm presenting a poster, which I may put in the space below for all to see, but to cut a long story short: *it's blue*.

I get to enjoy a 9.5 hour flight across the Atlantic, mostly by myself and hopefully I'll be blogging about it whilst I'm there, though I may have to go to talks and get quite drunk with my peers. Here's hoping...
