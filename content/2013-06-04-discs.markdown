So today we learnt about discs, as the title of this post may suggest. We had protoplanetary discs (or proplyds which is a horrible portmanteau), thin discs, thick discs, transitional discs...

This mostly involved theorists and simulations working their hardest, but we did get a few observational results thrown in for good measure. To be fair it's a simulation type topic, current methods are not powerful enough without some serious and therefore expensive time on the largest telescopes. Some nice analysis advances are being made but for once[^1] observationalists have to play catch up.

We finished with a public talk from Debra Fischer and a slightly US-centred view on the history of exoplanet discovery. There was one nice picture of Mayor and Queloz by the telescope. A good day in all.
