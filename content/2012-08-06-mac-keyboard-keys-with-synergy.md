title: Mac keyboard keys with Synergy

Synergy is a great program to control multiple computers from a single keyboard or mouse even without them being plugged in. The only requirement is that theyre on the same local network.

Im sharing my configuration which has my windows desktop as the server, and my macbook as the client. Using a windows keyboard creates some issues with the macbook, so here are the settings I use to map the keys correctly:

Shift - Shift
Ctrl - Ctrl
Alt - Meta
Meta - Meta
Super - Alt
Also I use the fix CAPSLOCK key setting.

This gives the same control layout as my mac (ie I can operate the cmd key with my left thumb) whilst remaining compatible.
