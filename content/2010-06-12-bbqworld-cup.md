Just been to a bbq at a friends house during which we watched the first
world cup 2010 game that we were involved in (England vs. USA). Twas
pretty rubbish really, 1-1 end score plus a complete fumble by the
England goalkeeper. Not exactly decisive!

Anway the bbq was good, ate too much as per usual but got to play some
footy in the park. In all a good night.
