I'm currently on the plane back, flying over Canada at about 922km/h as the in-flight computer (android tablet in the back of the seat in front of me) says.

I'm sitting next to a nice chinese couple, who don't speak a word of English. They asked me through vague hand gestures to fill out their immigration card. It was quite an ordeal! 

Back home now after a good conference, got lots of nice pictures of Vancouver, but am quite tired now.
