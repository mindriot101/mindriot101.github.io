                    <p><em>Update:</em> Wed 27 Feb 2013, since I'm updating this blog, chrome and firefox and safari all support this feature. </p>
<p>Google Chrome has* one, Firefox has one but Safari does not... until
now!</p>
<p>For me, having a manual "load flash only when I tell you to" button in a
web browser is a must. This reduces CPU usage on my mac which increases
battery life and stops it getting too hot. These are nice things to
have!</p>
<p>I understand some people might not want such a feature, but I do so I
did some quick googling and came up withÂ <a href="http://clicktoflash.com/">http://clicktoflash.com/</a>.
It creates a nice smooth looking flash image (shown below) which you
click to add the flash item itself.</p>
<p>It also includes a whitelist for sites you know to be ok. Check it out
if you run safari on a mac (seeing as windows does not have this problem
- its only selling point really!)</p>
