                    <p>I'm learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> at the moment, which I'm finding quite an interesting
challenge.  I agree with a lot of the Rust principles and find it extremely
comforting that the compiler has got my back, but it's bringing me back to my
early times learning C and "fighting with the compiler".</p>
<p>How many hours did I spend adding "&amp;" and "*" to variables to pass into
functions before I really understood what it meant for a function to take a
pointer? Simple rules like:</p>
<ol>
<li>if a function takes a pointer argument and expects a "simple" data type,
    e.g.  integer then pass the address of a variable with "&amp;"</li>
<li>if a function expects an array, then the array variable is equivalent to a
    pointer already so just pass the array variable</li>
<li>if a function expects a <em>double</em> pointer "**" then it expects to change
    the value of a normal pointer, so treat the pointer itself like a single
    variable in point 1 above.</li>
</ol>
<p>During one of his talks, Steve Klabnik stated that he no longer thinks of
"fighting the compiler", but instead considers it like a helpful friend passing
warnings about inadvisable behaviour.</p>
<p>I can't say I've reached that stage yet.  It very much feels to me like when I
was learning C again.  Quite nice in a way, reminding me of my roots but on the
other hand I find it very un-reassuring.  The key is that I don't understand
<em>why</em> the compiler is complaining - I haven't taken the language rules to heart
yet.  I've read the excellent <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">rust book</a> in its entirity, but this
does not mean I <em>know</em> the rules.  I know that with time it will come, and the
more I use the language the easier it will be. </p>
<p>I have two learning projects on the go at the moment.  The first is an attempt
to wrap a <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">C astronomy library</a> enabling access to the FITS data
format, and hopefully allowing me and others in the astronomy community to
start using Rust.  The second is a small remote API fetcher, with the idea to
run on my raspberry pi with a temperature sensor, and compare the predictions
made by weather models to the measured temperature.</p>
<p>My FITS library is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fitsio">up on crates.io</a>, and the API fetcher is on
<a href="https://github.com/mindriot101/met-office-tester">github</a>, comments are welcome!</p>
<p>I look forward to productive times with Rust.  As a Python user with a
background in C/C++, I like the way Rust straddles the two - the memory safety
of Python but without a garbage collector, and the close-to-the-metal speed and
efficiency of C/C++.  I've been looking for a compiled language with RAII that
isn't C++ for ages.</p>
