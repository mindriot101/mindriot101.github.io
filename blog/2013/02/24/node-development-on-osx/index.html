                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>I love my Macbook Pro, for development and general computing use. Before I
purchased it I was a die hard linux user (apart from gaming which is still
dominated by windows unfortunately.) My work involves linux<sup id="fnref:my-job"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:my-job" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and I am a
committed <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a> user. </p>
<p>My work colleagues tend to laugh when I say that I want to use my mouse as
little as possible, and that I am quite experienced in command line use. It
pains me every time I see my office mates reach over to the mouse to click the
<em>save</em> button.</p>
<p>This workflow does not translate too well to the Mac; as far as I understand it
Apple<sup id="fnref:nextstep"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nextstep" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> were one of the first companies to introduce guis for their
operating systems.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>On the other hand I love the user interface, operating system and window/font
rendering systems. It's quality hardware and a fantastic (IMO) keyboard,
coupled with excellent software and makes me feel really good using it. It's
become my main operating system at work now since I code almost exclusively on
my macbook. Occasionally I have to SSH into the work computers to access data
but usually this is from my laptop.</p>
<p>I also like automation.</p>
<p>During (node) development I much prefer editing code in my editor and either
seeing it instantly in my browser, or just reloading it myself. For this and
other development, I use a few tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> for package installation</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=2342">Better snap tool</a> for tiling windows
  side by side</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">Macvim</a> for editing, <code>brew install macvim</code></li>
<li><a href="http://www.iterm2.com">iTerm2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joh/when-changed">when-changed.py</a> for
  compiling/running/whatever when files have changed</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll discuss these tools in turn.</p>
<h2>Homebrew</h2>
<p>Linux has it's share of problems, which should be classed as more <em>challenges</em>
than problems as it's fun I assure you. On the other hand it's package
management system is top notch. The Mac OSX equivalent is Homebrew and is
superbly managed with packages on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. This takes the
difficulty out of installing a lot of packages, but is still missing some nice
features.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Linux's package management is that the packages are
<em>binary</em> packages, so no compilation is required. They are compiled by someone
with extensive knowledge of the package and operating system - usually the
package maintainer. Packages on Mac OSX still have to be compiled from source
so can take a long time.</p>
<h2>Better snap tool</h2>
<p>Having multiple windows open simultaneously is a huge timesaver as you can see
the contents simultaneously. Having multiple monitors is a fantastic but
expensive option, but if on a single window you could resize the windows
yourself but this can be time consuming if it needs to be done many times.</p>
<p>This tool allows some keyboard shortcuts to resize the windows to take up half
the screen each. There exists a keyboard shortcut for restoring the windows
back to their original position as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="{{" title="site.url }}/assets/images/screencap.png" /></p>
<p>The reason I chose this tool over other similar tools is that it allows for a
nice border around windows which I could not find with other tools. It's a
small point but I like to keep the look of OSX as much as possible and I feel
like non-fullscreen windows fits this bill.</p>
<h2>Macvim</h2>
<p>I mentioned that vim is my editor of choice, and macvim is the epitome of this
editor for OSX.</p>
<h2>iTerm2</h2>
<p>This is a great replacement for the Terminal.app that ships with OSX but
otherwise is a simple terminal emulator. It has nice support for profiles (e.g.
setting up an ssh link from a few keystrokes). </p>
<h2>when-changed.py</h2>
<p>This script watches for filesystem changes, and runs a simple command when
something is different.</p>
<p>The command used for writing this blog post is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>when-changed.py <span class="k">$(</span>find content -name <span class="s1">&#39;*.md&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span> -c <span class="s1">&#39;fab build&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Any time I save the post, by build system (<a href="http://fabfile.org">fabric</a>)
recompiles the post so I can just reload the browser to see the changes.</p>
<h3>Application to node</h3>
<p><a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a> actually comes with a tool similar to
<code>when-changed.py</code>, it's called <code>supervisor</code>, and can be installed globally with
npm: <code>npm install --global supervisor</code>. It can reload the server file with any
changes. I can edit it in one pane with macvim, and view the changes in the
browser by just reloading the page.</p>
