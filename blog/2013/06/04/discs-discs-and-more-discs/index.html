                    <p>So today we learnt about discs, as the title of this post may suggest. We had protoplanetary discs (or proplyds which is a horrible portmanteau), thin discs, thick discs, transitional discs...</p>
<p>This mostly involved theorists and simulations working their hardest, but we did get a few observational results thrown in for good measure. To be fair it's a simulation type topic, current methods are not powerful enough without some serious and therefore expensive time on the largest telescopes. Some nice analysis advances are being made but for once<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> observationalists have to play catch up.</p>
<p>We finished with a public talk from Debra Fischer and a slightly US-centred view on the history of exoplanet discovery. There was one nice picture of Mayor and Queloz by the telescope. A good day in all.</p>
