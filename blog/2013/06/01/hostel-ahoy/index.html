                    <p>So we arrived at the hostel, a very nice place too. I'd recommend it if I could be bothered to find out what it is. I'll try and remember to insert a reference here:</p>

<p>So yeah nice place. Vancouver is not very exciting so far but as was pointed out to me: the area around the airport is never going to be very nice.</p>
<p>The public transport on the other hand seems excellent so far. I'll not get much of a chance to test it out, but from what I've seen so far it's excellent. Fantastic public transport to and from the airport, something London sorely needs.</p>
<p>The city itself looks pretty good too, some fancy shops with names I've never heard of, and Claire's accessories of course. That infects every city it touches these days, but that's another topic for another day.</p>
<p>We're just about to go get some food and some drinks. I've been up since 6am which makes the writing of this post the 20th hour of being awake. It's not really hitting me yet, but I'm sure I'll sleep well tonight!</p>
<p>More astronomy to follow, probably.</p>
