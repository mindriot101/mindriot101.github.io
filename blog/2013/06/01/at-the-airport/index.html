                    <p>So we're at the airport. Mostly uneventful journey so far, luckily. Airports terrify me; flying doesn't scare me at all, but the chance of being rejected for something as simple as forgetting your passport is so unnerving.</p>
<p>I've been up since 6am this morning, which is pretty tough. I've managed to get some free wifi at the airport, ironically from BT Openzone which have announced that they're <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22728977">closing to O2 customers</a>. This is ironic for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As an O2 customer I was not aware of this ability before today (ok this is not technically irony)</li>
<li>I'm checking the internet through BT OpenZone as we speak!</li>
</ol>
<p>In other news, much more sad this time, a co-founder of the fantastic Oculus Rift was announced to be the <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/orange_county&amp;id=9122999">pedestrian who was killed recently in a police chace</a>. I'm not sure how this will affect the company, or the development of the rift as a whole; I've not been following development but I've heard some good things about it from many sources.</p>
<p>About to board the plane soon, then the long flight where my laptop battery will be tested to its limits. Another post soon, providing I can get some time. So much learning to be done.</p>
