                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Ok so after my <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/2013/08/26/ruby-first-impressions/">previous post</a>, I was feeling pretty excited about Ruby. I talked about its power and flexibility and the exciting things that could come from it.</p>
<p>I also talked of Ruby's scariness, it's ability to terrify new programmers and potential for difficulties.</p>
<p>I've found one particular example which I'm sure shouldn't be allowed. I can see the intention and how in experienced hands it is amazing, but I can't unsee it's potential for misuse.</p>
<p>In Ruby you can add functionality by redeclaring the class you want to extend and add methods, or overwrite/extend methods. </p>
<p>This is not the same as inheriting: you must create a new name in a standard inheritance chain. Not with Ruby; you can put the desired functionality straight into the class.</p>
<p>This I talked about before. What I didn't talk about before (probably because I never thought of it) is that any subclasses of your "new" class will inherit this new behaviour.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion of this is thus: everything in Ruby inherits from <code>Object</code>. What about adding methods to <code>Object</code>?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Object</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Printing foo&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">foo</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; Printing foo</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This example is harmless - mostly harmless ;) - but what about in a gem you make public:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Object</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span>
    <span class="c1"># Launch the nukes</span>
    <span class="c1"># ... or system &quot;rm -rf *&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># user: &quot;The documentation tells me that to do something awesome, call 3.foo&quot;</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">foo</span>

<span class="c1"># BANG!</span>
