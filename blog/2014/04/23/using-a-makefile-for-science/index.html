                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>The declarative style of a Makefile (or substitute your own language-of-choice's implementation of *akefiles) lends itself well to scientific processes, where a reproducible method is crucial. I recently found this out when analysing some data, which consisted of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>compile the source code of the programs I was using</li>
<li>use these programs on the same data</li>
<li>plot some summary plots</li>
<li>show the plots</li>
</ol>
<p>With the declarative style of Makefiles I could rely on the latest results no matter what changed in the analysis path, for example the plot scripts used in step 3. were listed as a dependency of the step run to make the plots so when the script changed, the plots would be recreated. </p>
<p>Another advantage is that step 2. took a long time, so the "update only when the dependency is out of date" style of makefiles really came in handy. I could change the (relatively quick) plotting scripts to my hearts content safe in the knowledge that the data I was using was up to date.</p>
<p>For scientific analysis, reproducibility is of prime concern, and should I come back to this project at a later date, the combination of a makefile plus the fact that the project was stored in a git repository makes the code easy to use (the readme just contains the line: <code>make</code>) and consistent.</p>
<p>A small tip that I did not know before starting out on this endeavour (and is specific to GNU make) is to use <code>$(MAKE)</code> whenever running make in a subdirectory. This enables parallel job flags (e.g. <code>-j 4</code>) to be passed down to subsequent make invocations.</p>
<p>For reference, I was getting the message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">warning</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">jobserver</span> <span class="n">unavailable</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">using</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">j1</span><span class="o">.</span>  <span class="n">Add</span> <span class="err">`</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="err">&#39;</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">parent</span> <span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">rule</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>when calling subtasks with a simple <code>make</code>. Now with <code>$(MAKE)</code> the jobs run in parallel where possible.</p>
