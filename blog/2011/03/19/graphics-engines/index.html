                    <p>Ive been looking into graphics engines recently, though this can only be a part time hobby for me since I should be doing my PhD work
Ive mostly been looking at two in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ogre</li>
<li>Irrlicht</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these seem to have some pros and cons, which I will be detailing in a second. I cannot decide which one I prefer though so maybe you can help me out? Comments are welcome.</p>
<h2>Ogre</h2>
<p>Lets start with this one. Perhaps the more fully featured engine, and used in some pretty famous games, it comes out of the box with some nice shader support and a great tutorial which is easy to follow and gets you creating a scene in no time at all.
This is one of my main problems though: the tutorial really hides all the workings of what actually goes on in the engine from the tutorial follower as its all contained in a TutorialApplication class which handles things like setting up a camera, and rendering the settings box and gui.
This is very nice to get a quick application going but doesnt really teach you anything about the API. I suppose this might be explained further in the tutorial but I never followed it that far (probably shouldnt admit that but never mind!).</p>
<h2>Irrlicht</h2>
<p>Had never heard of this one before I did some googling. It is less well known as far as I can tell, but still used in some highly commended games.
The nicest difference is the tutorial exposes all the code to the user, which can make the initial tutorials a little lacking in functionality (eg. no fps mouse controls) but helps you understand much more.
Comparison
Some differences in the use of the two engines are:
Transformations - Ogre uses quaternions, a rotation around a vector, whereas Irrlicht uses rotation matrices which are much easier to comprehend
Utility classes - Irrlicht has such things as vector3class T which call a templated function for class T. Ogre uses a built in (though it may be a typedef) Vector class.
I am planning on adding to this post as I find more differences and this is only a brief first impressions post, and I still cannot decide which I prefer!</p>
