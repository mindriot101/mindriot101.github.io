post, you have been warned...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work we use Windows. I vowed when I left my last job that I'd never
go to work somewhere that uses Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very much still not a fan, especially since I have not got admin
rights and we are using Windows 8 - one of the most hated versions of
Windows since ME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Linux personally and professionaly for a decade now, and am so optimised to live on the command line that Windows is
genuinely slowing me down at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few programs that help with this. They do not recreate my
life on the command line as before, but they help with general
behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mouse-dragging of windows&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Linux desktop environments support dragging a window by holding Alt
and dragging with the left mouse button. Additionally, some of them
support resizing windows by holding alt and dragging with the right
mouse button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stefansundin.github.io/altdrag/"&gt;AltDrag&lt;/a&gt; is the program that
provides this functionality for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Scrolling the inactive window&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux, scrolling the mouse wheel over an inactive window scrolls the
content. This does not happen on Windows, at least Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href="https://stefansundin.github.io/altdrag/"&gt;AltDrag&lt;/a&gt; provides this
functionality and is crucial when for example, writing some notes on a
webpage and scrolling the page without selecting the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Task launcher&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 8 search functionality for programs is abysmal. Compared to
the lightning pace of life when on the command line, the Windows 8
search box performance is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's accuracy were perfect, I'd try to put up with the terrible
performance, but it also is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched to &lt;a href="http://executor.dk/"&gt;Executor&lt;/a&gt; which I've bound to the
Spotlight-default Alt+Space. It starts instantly, looks great, and finds
programs very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vimium&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a feature that I use in Linux as well. Given I use
&lt;a href="https://www.vim.org"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; as my text editor, I am so acustomed to the
key bindings and modal editing in general, I strive to use Vim
keybindings everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried many Vim shortcut plugins for my web browser over the
years, and &lt;a href="https://vimium.github.io/"&gt;Vimium&lt;/a&gt; is the best I've found.
Since Firefox switched to WebExtensions, this plugin has worked with
Firefox reinforcing my opinion that Firefox is my favourite browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of living life on the command line is never using the mouse.
Windows has some general keyboard shortcuts that can help, and some
programs have shortcuts that help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Text editors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, my text editor of choice &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; is
supported on Windows, as is &lt;a href="https://neovim.io/"&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also having good success using &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;Visual Studio
Code&lt;/a&gt; - with &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim"&gt;Vim
keybindings&lt;/a&gt;,
including true Neovim integration. The plugin ecosystem is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Portable apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not really a program that makes Windows feel more like Linux,
but it does help getting around the lack of admin rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://portableapps.com/"&gt;Portable Apps&lt;/a&gt; are a way to run quote a lot
of Windows programs without "proper" installation. I presume this means
they do not need to set registry keys&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; etc. This way I can have my
text editor, a decent web browser and a few other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't get me started on a global binary method of storing
  configuration, rather than simple plain-text scripts in standard
  locations...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
