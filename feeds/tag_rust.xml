installed certificates. I was getting certificate errors trying to
install rust with the &lt;a href="https://www.rustup.rs/"&gt;rustup&lt;/a&gt; tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried searching for any help at all but in the end I followed the
following advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download a more recent certificate bundle (e.g. from
&lt;a href="https://certifi.io/en/latest/"&gt;certifi&lt;/a&gt; or mozilla)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the environment variable &lt;code&gt;SSL_CERT_FILE&lt;/code&gt; to point to this new file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for both &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cargo&lt;/code&gt; meaning I can develop with rust
on my work machine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rust"></category></entry><entry><title>Fighting the compiler</title><link href="https://blog.simonrw.com/blog/2016/06/01/fighting-the-compiler/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-06-01T08:40:18+01:00</updated><author><name>Simon Walker</name></author><id>tag:blog.simonrw.com,2016-06-01:blog/2016/06/01/fighting-the-compiler/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm learning &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; at the moment, which I'm finding quite an interesting
challenge.  I agree with a lot of the Rust principles and find it extremely
comforting that the compiler has got my back, but it's bringing me back to my
early times learning C and "fighting with the compiler".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many hours did I spend adding "&amp;amp;" and "*" to variables to pass into
functions before I really understood what it meant for a function to take a
pointer? Simple rules like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a function takes a pointer argument and expects a "simple" data type,
    e.g.  integer then pass the address of a variable with "&amp;amp;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a function expects an array, then the array variable is equivalent to a
    pointer already so just pass the array variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a function expects a &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; pointer "**" then it expects to change
    the value of a normal pointer, so treat the pointer itself like a single
    variable in point 1 above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of his talks, Steve Klabnik stated that he no longer thinks of
"fighting the compiler", but instead considers it like a helpful friend passing
warnings about inadvisable behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say I've reached that stage yet.  It very much feels to me like when I
was learning C again.  Quite nice in a way, reminding me of my roots but on the
other hand I find it very un-reassuring.  The key is that I don't understand
&lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the compiler is complaining - I haven't taken the language rules to heart
yet.  I've read the excellent &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"&gt;rust book&lt;/a&gt; in its entirity, but this
does not mean I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the rules.  I know that with time it will come, and the
more I use the language the easier it will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two learning projects on the go at the moment.  The first is an attempt
to wrap a &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html"&gt;C astronomy library&lt;/a&gt; enabling access to the FITS data
format, and hopefully allowing me and others in the astronomy community to
start using Rust.  The second is a small remote API fetcher, with the idea to
run on my raspberry pi with a temperature sensor, and compare the predictions
made by weather models to the measured temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My FITS library is &lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/fitsio"&gt;up on crates.io&lt;/a&gt;, and the API fetcher is on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mindriot101/met-office-tester"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, comments are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to productive times with Rust.  As a Python user with a
background in C/C++, I like the way Rust straddles the two - the memory safety
of Python but without a garbage collector, and the close-to-the-metal speed and
efficiency of C/C++.  I've been looking for a compiled language with RAII that
isn't C++ for ages.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="rust"></category></entry></feed>
